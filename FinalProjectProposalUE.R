# - Portal El Dorado: 10,000 (major station)
# - NormandÃ­a: 6,000 (intermediate station)
# - CAN: 6,000 (intermediate station)
# - Ciudad Universitaria: 6,000 (intermediate station)

# Expected effect of the intervention (average treatment effect)
ate <- 0.02  # 2% reduction in fare evasion due to the informational campaign

# Variability of fare evasion rates

# Correlation between pre-test and post-test rates
rho <- 0.7   # Fare evasion should be consistent in time, therefore, high corre
#lation expected.

# Missing data proportion

# DESIGN
# ======================
